# ðŸ§± Lego Data Analysis Project

This project is a simple data analysis task based on a guided project from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), where we explore the history and development of Lego sets using Python and pandas. The analysis covers the evolution of Lego over time, such as the number of sets released per year, themes introduced, and part diversity.
